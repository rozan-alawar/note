# NOTE APP

<p>A note app built with Flutter is a great way to keep track of your ideas, tasks, and reminders. 
With this note app, you can create, edit, and delete notes quickly and easily. The app has a user-friendly interface that allows you to organize your notes by categories or tags. You can also search for notes using keywords and filter them by date, category, or tag.

The app also comes with a dark mode feature, which is easy on the eyes and helps reduce eye strain.
